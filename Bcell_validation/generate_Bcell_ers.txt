
3â€™ intergenic ERs in B cells were detected using the pipeline detailed in Zhang et al. 2020
The code is available here: https://github.com/dzhang32/ER_paper_2020_supp_code

Following were the steps used to generate ERs:
1. use generate_ERs_varying_cutoffs.R
2. use merge_chrs_varying_cutoffs.R
3. use generate_ERs_varying_maxgaps.R
4. use optimise_cutoff_exonDelta.R
5. use optimise_cutoff_exonDelta_analysis.R
6. use annotate_ERs.R

The Zhang et al. pipeline has also been wrapped into a R package: https://github.com/dzhang32/ODER 


The ERs were then processed in the same as GTEx ERs. Please see https://github.com/sid-sethi/F3UTER/tree/master/ER_data_processing for details
 - use er_initial_processing.pl
 - use er_dataset_generate_for_analysis.R


Omic features and feature matrix were calculated in the same way as GTEx data. Please see https://github.com/sid-sethi/F3UTER/tree/master/OmicFeature_generation for details.
